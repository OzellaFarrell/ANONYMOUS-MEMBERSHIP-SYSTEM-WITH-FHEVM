ANONYMOUS MEMBERSHIP SYSTEM WITH FHEVM - VIDEO NARRATION SCRIPT

---

INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Anonymous Membership System with FHEVM. This is a comprehensive framework for building privacy-preserving membership systems using Fully Homomorphic Encryption on the blockchain. Today, we're demonstrating a complete, production-ready FHEVM development ecosystem that enables developers to create confidential smart contracts.

---

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is a Zama Developer Program bounty submission that showcases best practices for FHEVM development. We have built 12 production-ready smart contracts covering everything from basic encryption patterns to advanced applications like sealed-bid auctions and confidential token systems.

The system includes 8 comprehensive test suites with over 104 test cases, 3 automation scripts for rapid project generation, and complete documentation including guides, FAQs, and troubleshooting resources. Everything is designed to be immediately useful for developers building privacy-preserving applications.

INSTALLATION AND COMPILATION

Let's start with installation. We clone the repository, install dependencies using npm install, and then compile our contracts using npm run compile. The Hardhat FHEVM plugin automatically compiles all our smart contracts and generates the necessary artifacts for testing and deployment.

---

RUNNING TESTS

Now we run the comprehensive test suite with npm run test. Our 104+ tests demonstrate the correct patterns for building with FHEVM. Each test includes privacy verification, ensuring that encrypted values don't leak their plaintext forms.

The tests cover SimpleMembership with 15 tests, FHEArithmetic with 12 tests, EqualityComparison, EncryptSingleValue, EncryptMultipleValues, RoleBasedAccess with 18 tests, ConfidentialERC20 with 18 tests, and BlindAuction with 23 tests.

All tests pass successfully, demonstrating correct FHE patterns including encrypted input handling, proof validation, and permission management.

AUTOMATION TOOLS

One of the key features of this project is our automation tools. With a single command, npm run create-example basic-member, we generate a standalone project with everything needed to run that specific example.

The tool automatically creates the contract file, comprehensive test suite, configuration files, and documentation. This generated project can be immediately cloned, installed, compiled, and tested independently.

We can generate examples for any of our patterns: basic-member, fhe-arithmetic, equality-comparison, encrypt-single-value, encrypt-multiple-values, user-decrypt-single, public-decrypt-single, role-based-access, and common-pitfalls.

SMART CONTRACTS

Our 12 contracts demonstrate the full spectrum of FHEVM capabilities. In the basic category, we have SimpleMembership for member registration, FHEArithmetic for encrypted arithmetic operations, and EqualityComparison for encrypted comparisons.

For encryption patterns, we show single and multiple value encryption with proper proof validation. For decryption, we demonstrate user-side decryption, public decryption, and multi-value decryption patterns.

RoleBasedAccess shows how to implement encrypted permissions. BlindAuction demonstrates a real-world application with privacy-preserving sealed bids and encrypted comparisons.

Finally, we provide ERC7984-style confidential tokens including ConfidentialERC20 for encrypted token transfers and ConfidentialVesting for time-locked encrypted token distribution.

KEY FEATURES

All our contracts follow FHEVM best practices. Each encrypted value has proper permission management using the critical pattern of FHE.allowThis for contract permissions and FHE.allow for user permissions.

All input values are validated with zero-knowledge proofs through FHE.fromExternal. Event emission happens without revealing encrypted amounts, maintaining complete privacy.

The contracts support encrypted arithmetic, encrypted comparisons, and advanced patterns like sealed auctions and token operations, all while maintaining privacy throughout.

DOCUMENTATION

We provide comprehensive documentation including getting started guides, detailed pattern guides for inputs, handles, and permissions, a complete FAQ covering general questions through development issues, and a full troubleshooting guide for compilation, test, type, permission, and runtime issues.

Each guide includes real examples and explanations of why privacy patterns matter.

SUMMARY

This project demonstrates what's possible when building with FHEVM. We have 12 production-ready contracts, 104+ comprehensive tests, 3 automation tools, and complete documentation.

Every contract follows best practices for privacy and security. Every test includes privacy verification. Every pattern is documented and reusable.

The project is ready for production use and provides a solid foundation for building privacy-preserving membership systems and other confidential applications on the blockchain.
